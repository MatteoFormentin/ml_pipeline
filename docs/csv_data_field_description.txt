SIAE Dataset column descriptions
The dataset provide measure of QoS of 10841 microwave links in both the (In links the direction are independent and carried by two different antennas) collected every 15 minutes

keyword: 
    FIXED -> The field is a costant
    USELESS -> the field is useless (since is used to extract this dataset or not used)
    DISCARDED - The field is discarded since unreiable

Coloumn description:
idlink -> Identification of radio link
area -> group differet link together FIXED USELESS
provider -> other group option FIXED USELESS
ramo -> identify one of the two direction (1: A->B, 2: B->A) FIXED
data -> timestamp of log
ip_a -> ip of sender FIXED
ip_b -> ip of receiver FIXED
protection -> prtotection techinque on link FIXED
uas -> Unavailable seconds, number of seconds when the system is unavailable in a measurement interval. Computed as the sum of all the time interval containing at least ten consecutive severely errored seconds in at least one direction of transmission. USELESS
es ->  count of one-second period with one or more errored blocks or at least one defect USELESS
ses -> count of severely errored seconds (errors more severe than es). The system is defined unavailable, when are measured ten consecutive severely errored seconds USELESS
RxNominal -> nominal received power FIXED
txMaxA, txminA ,rxmaxA, rxminA, txMaxB, txminB, rxmaxB, rxminB -> Max/Min value of Tx/Rx for direction A/B in the 15 minutes window
acmMax -> lowest modulation reached in the 15 minutes measures (DISCARDED since scarse in DB)
isG828Ok, isRxPwrOk, isTxPwrOk -> Equipment Status metric. If one the metrics in the log are reliable. USELESS (Since only good status equipment on DB)
sn -> SNR on the link in latest second before log collecting
rxRef -> FIXED
txRef -> FIXED
snA -> SNR of direction A in latest second before log collecting
snB -> SNR of direction B in latest second before log collecting
acmSnA -> lowest modulation reached in latest second before log collecting on direction A
acmSnB -> lowest modulation reached in latest second before log collecting on direction B
rxSnA -> received signal in latest second before log collecting on direction A
rxSnB -> received signal in latest second before log collecting on direction B
eqtype -> Identifier of the model of equipment FIXED
acmLowerMode -> Lowest (Slower) modulation used in trasmission (Adaptive rate based on BER) FIXED
acmUpperMode -> Highest (Fastest) modulation used in trasmission (Adaptive rate based on BER) FIXED
acmEngine -> Identify is the ACM (Adaptive code modulation) is active (0/1). If active switch the MCS on the range defined by acmLowerMode and acmUpperMode
freqband -> carrier frequency of the link FIXED
bandwidth -> carrier bandwidth of the link FIXED
